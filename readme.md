# Technical Assignment - Leanon Systems

This repository contains all the tasks resolved, separate by folders and subfolders.
Most of the programming questions were solved using both PHP and Javascript.

### How To Test

- To test Javascrript files, you can use your own browser **Developer Tools**. Press CTRL + Shift + I to open it and paste the desired code.
- To test PHP files, you can use an online php runner, such as **onlinephp.io**, run locally or access the link I provided in each of the .php files.
- To test the SQL files, you can run a SQL Database (such as MariaDB, MySQL, Postges) locally and execute it in your terminal or use a SQL Client software, for example: phpMyAdmin, DBeaver, MySQL Workbench or similars. Be aware that you will need tables filled with data to see the query working.

Math assignments have my way of thinking and how I calculated it in a text file.

### Process:

I took about 3 hours to solve all the assignments (and a couple more hours to solve the last one - Paint Bucket),
create the repository, organize folder structure, run the code files with examples and add comments.
